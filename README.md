This project investigates the performance and behavior of regression models applied to two biomedical datasets: the Parkinson’s Telemonitoring dataset https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/189/parkinsons+telemonitoring and the Breast Cancer Diagnostic dataset https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic. The workflow begins with comprehensive data pre‑processing, including normalization, handling missing values, feature selection, and exploratory statistical analysis. For the Parkinson’s dataset, an analytical closed‑form solution to linear regression is implemented using the normal equation, while the Breast Cancer dataset is modeled using logistic regression optimized through gradient‑based methods.
